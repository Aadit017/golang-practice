# Learning Golang under 72 hours
![Go Logo](https://d1q6f0aelx0por.cloudfront.net/product-logos/library-golang-logo.png)
Hey there , Im [Aadit](https://github.com/Aadit017) , a second year student currently pursuing ece with passion for coding. I've currently taken on this challenge to learn Golang within 72 hours and create a Demo Terminal [like hyperterminal] using golang and serveral other dependencies. I'll be mentioning the sources used as I move along the way.

# Sources used 

 - [FreeCodeCamps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un6ZyFkqFKo) youtube video 
 - [Golang's](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started) Official documentation 
 - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) cos we're smart

## Main Project 

The end goal of this challenge is to make a terminal using Golang. Ill try to add in as many functionalities as possible it should have the following as a bare minimum:-

 - Simple Layout 
 - Option to toggle between dark mode and light mode
 - Allowing the commands to be operated without facing any errors 


## Learning Curve

My goal is to learn enough of this language to make my project easily without any hurdle. I already know languages such as Java, Javascript , Python and C , so working with golang should'nt be that big of a problem for me ~~or is it~~

```Content being updated as I go through this```

- Currently , I've gone through the basics with the help of chat gpt . Didnt realize go had its own version of ``npm init`` which is ``go mod init <name>``. Ive made the folders and stuff , done a bit of Chat Gpt and now Im ready to go. I'll be surfing through the tutorial vid right now to learn some more.

- So , I wouldn't lie I had to work my way around getting used to the file structure in go. Apparently you import ``packages`` in go. I found this pretty weird cos I made two separate files in the same folder `root/learning/hello` and `root/learning/externalpck` and both of them contain this line of code `package main` . I couldnt declare the main function in my second file since `redeclaration` is not allowed in go. This made me realized that whatever is present inside a package , acts as a single thing of its own. Definitely different from the basic import and export structure of Java.

- Definitely enjoyed naming my variables with ``:=`` . Although its not a lot per say but it def makes the language fun to learn. Messed around a bit with modules and packages . Def wld be giving this topic extra attention.

- 2 hours into golang and I've decided to give the packages and import function of go another hour. I find the documentation very helpful at this point ,I wont lie its better than most tutorials out there.
